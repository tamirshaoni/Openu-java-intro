# Triangle Utilities in Java

This project provides utility classes for working with triangles in Java. It demonstrates geometric calculations, validation, and comparison of triangles using object-oriented programming principles.

## Project Structure

- [`Triangle1.java`](Triangle/Triangle1.java): Contains methods for validating triangles, calculating perimeter and area, and comparing triangles.
- [`Triangle2.java`](Triangle/Triangle2.java): Offers additional or alternative implementations for triangle-related operations.

## Features

- **Triangle Validation:** Ensures that the given sides can form a valid triangle.
- **Geometric Calculations:** Calculates the perimeter and area of triangles.
- **Triangle Comparison:** Compares triangles based on their properties.

## Usage

1. **Compile the Java files:**
   ```sh
   javac Triangle1.java Triangle2.java
